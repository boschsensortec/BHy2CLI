## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository with Submodules
To clone this repository along with all its submodules, use the following command:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/boschsensortec/BHy2CLI.git
```

## Initializing and Updating Submodules
If you have already cloned the repository without submodules, you can initialize and update them using:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Keeping Submodules Updated
To ensure submodules remain up to date when pulling the latest changes, run:

```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

Then, update the submodules using:

```sh
git submodule update --recursive
```


2. By default, BHI360 will be cloned as submodule and the source code and Makefile locate the BHI360 sensor API v2.2.0 under "submodules/bhi360/source".
   
### Steps to include a new sensor API (Optional)

1. Other BHI sensorAPI folder can be cloned inside the submodules

2. Update the Makefile of the CLI to include definitions and source code for the new sensor API. Follow these steps:
   - Add the location of the new sensor API:
	 ```
	 CLIxxx_API_LOCATION ?= submodules/bhixxx/source
	 ```
   - Add the source files of the new sensor API to the build process:
	 ```
	 CLIxxx_API_SRCS := $(wildcard $(CLIxxx_API_LOCATION)/*.c)
	 ```
   - Include the source files in the list of C source files:
	 ```
	 C_SRCS += \
	 $(CLIxxx_API_SRCS) \
	 ```
   - Add the API location to the include paths:
	 ```
	 INCLUDEPATHS += . \
	 $(CLIxxx_API_LOCATION) \
	 ```
3. In "bhy_defs.c", locate the `all_sensor_api_entry` array definition. Add the new api_entry inside. This ensures the CLI can recognize and use the new sensor API. For example:
   ```c
   #include "bhixxx_api_entry.h"
   #include "bhixxx_defs.h"
   ```

   ```c
   static const ChipAPIEntry all_sensor_api_entry[] = {
	..., { BHIxxx_CHIP_ID, bhixxx_sensor_api_entry }, { 0, NULL } /* End of
																   * table
																   * marker */
   };
   ```

## Release package

Release package helps to generate executables and binaries of BHy2CLI , which can then be used to test BHy2CLI Application on PC/MCU in Application Board APP3.0 / APP3.1
### Creating Release package :
```
1.Open powershell in root directory of BHy2CLI project.
2.For TARGET PC, run .\scripts\build.bat
3.For TARGET MCU_APP30, run .\scripts\build_app30.bat
4.For TARGET MCU_APP31, run .\scripts\build_app31.bat
```
#### Release folder structure :
		 - BHI3-firmwares/BHI360 : Holds BHI360 firmwares
		 - firmware              : Holds bootloader, coines_bridge and MTP firmwares for APP3.0 and APP3.1
		 - MCU                   : Holds APP3.0 and APP3.1 BHy2CLI binaries (I2C, SPI) and batch files to write BHI360 firmwares (present in BHI3-firmwares/BHI360) to External FLASH
		 - PC                    : Holds executables for BHy2CLI (I2C, SPI) and decompressor
			 - Executables are present in,
				 - PC/bin/x86 for 32-bit compiler
				 - PC/bin/x64 for 64-bit compiler
		 - tools                 : Holds app_switch and usb-dfu files required to flash coines_bridge firmware (for TARGET PC) and to write BHI360 firmwares to External FLASH (for TARGET MCU_APP30 and MCU_APP31)
